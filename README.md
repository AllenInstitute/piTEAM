Parallel Imaging Pipeline Using Transmission Electron Automated Microscopes (piTEAM)

This repository will link to the services that are part of the piTEAM software ecosystem. We are currently working on updating our code for public release.

### Currently Public Repositories
- [TileQC](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/TileQC) - stand alone service to analyze image tile quality with various filters.

### Remaining Repositories 
- pyTEM - TEM acqusition software.
- pyTEM Server - Server for remote control of the system.
- pyTEM GUI - Web-based front end.
- TEM Graph - GPU-base image processing pipeline.
- TAOdb - (TEM Acqustion Object) database stores ROI information.
- TEMdb - database that holds records of ROIs that are acquired.
